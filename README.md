# Research
## Goals
- Create a good classifier to predict the attrition of a employee correctly
- Use the classifier to help the company preven further attrition by making necessary changes by using reverse modelling

## Current Progress
- Created a stack ensembled classifier with a F1 score of 0.608 on test set and 0.78 on train set. Taking into account the lack of training examples ( about 1200 ) this is   considerably a good score

## To do
- Identify Slack variables
- Creating priority between them
- Finding the best possible changes the company can make
