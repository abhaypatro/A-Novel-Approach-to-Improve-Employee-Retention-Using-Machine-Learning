# Research
## Goals
- Create a good classifier to predict the attrition of a employee correctly
- Use the classifier to help the company preven further attrition by making necessary changes by using reverse modelling

## Current Progress
- Created a stack ensembled classifier with a F1 score of 0.608 on test set and 0.78 on train set. Taking into account the lack of training examples ( about 1200 ) this is   considerably a good score

## To do
- Identify Slack variables
- Creating priority between them
- Finding the best possible changes the company can make

## Inputs 
- Company to decide on the willingness factor ( think of a better name :) ) to change the variable on a scale of ( 0 - 100), which will be normalized so that all factors add up to 

## Output
- Various possible changes will be found using the classifier, the one with the lowest change required will be the best possible solution
